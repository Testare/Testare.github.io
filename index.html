                <p>Hi, my name is Logan Woodbury.</p>
                <p>
                    I am formally studying for a Bachelor's degree in Computer 
                    Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. But informally,
                    I've been studying computers online since before I entered
                    high school in 2008, reading online tutorials on HTML, sneaking
                    peeks into my "Java for Dummies" book while the teacher wasn't 
                    paying attention, and taking many summer classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy learning new things, new technologies, etc. Most of my
                    personal projects were created less for their own 
                    accomplishment than for my learning and expirementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've chosen a couple of the more distinguished ones to mention
                    on this website, you'll find links in the header, as well as a
                    link to my github profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of computer related projects, I enjoy reading some good
                    sci-fi/fantasy, watching TV with friends, and playing various
                    sorts of games. I also spend time on my other passion for
                    learning and practicing different languages. Je parle un peu le Français, et aussi très peu le 日本語。
