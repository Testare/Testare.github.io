                    "Retention Tree" was my nickname for a project I did while
                    I was serving as a volunteer representative (missionary)
                    for my church in eastern Canada. Our mission was using a 
                    process of calling to collect statistics for the different
                    areas, divided into zones, districts, and companionships.
                    These numbers would be collected on "Call-in sheets" and
                    passed up to the mission president.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a previous project, a friend of mine noticed my skills
                    with computers and decided to leverage it to expedite this
                    process, with approval from the mission president. Each 
                    area in the mission had a google account, so I used google 
                    sheets to create 6-week call in reports and send them 
                    around the mission. There was one for each district, then 
                    one for each "zone", and then one for the whole mission.
                    They were linked together so numbers reported on the 
                    district sheets displayed and were counted on the zone
                    and mission level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's an example of a district level sheet for 
                    Fredericton, New Brunswick, with dummy data filled in.
                </p>
                <img class="w3-image" src="img/FrederictonDistrict.png" />
                <p>
                    And here's an example of the mission wide sheet.
                    Note the district dummy data automatically tallied on the
                    page.

                <p>
                    While this initial creation was a success, once the 
                    6-week period was over, it lead to some confusion.
                    People were manually creating copies of the individual
                    pages, which were not properly linked together. Some
                    new districts and areas were created and others removed,
                    meaning not only new sheets but new rows added to sheets,
                    some rows removed. If this was done wrong, formulas in 
                    the spreadsheets would be removed. To ensure it was done
                    right, I had to manually recreate the new sheets for each
                    district, zone, and the mission, and share them out to the
                    respective emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I was nearing the end of my service, and this was
                    not an ideal long-term solution. I was asked if I could
                    was capable of creating an automatic process for it... and
                    so I did!
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a picture of the very simplistic website that runs
                    the script on Google Drive I created (A "Transfer" was the
                    term used for a 6-week period). Over course of the
                    project many modifications were made to what was required
                    of the sheets, and I did my best to accomodate with what
                    was possible of the technology and my ability at the time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The app ran off a central ".root" directory (hence why I
                    decided to call it "Retention Tree"). It had a spreadsheet
                    that had information on the amount of districts and 
                    companionships, their names and emails, and it had 
                    templates "seeds" for the spreadsheets. Finally, it had 
                    the actual script to run the thing, and a URL to the 
                    webapp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked hard on it, and it worked well for a good while.
                    After my service I still got a few calls about it. In the
                    end, the rules for managing sheet permissions were
                    difficult to automate, and some of the less tech-savvy
                    missionaries would accidentally find ways to break their
                    sheets, and consequently larger parts of the system.
                    It has always been reversable, but still a cause of pain.
                    After a few months at home I relinquished finally all
                    access to the project, after making this scrubbed copy
                    without private/mission information for my portfolio.
